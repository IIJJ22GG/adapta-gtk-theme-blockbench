======

A port of Adapta Nokto, an adaptive Gtk+ theme based on Material Design Guidelines, for Blockbench.


Before using Adapta
-------------------

#### Typography

Adapta strongly depends on Material Design resources, especially its **fonts**.

 1. [**Roboto**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
   - Very famous as the default truetype font in Android (English ver.).
   - Multilingual support is not good.

 2. [**Noto Sans**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans)
   - Noto (NO TOfu) sans-serif truetype/opentype font covers a lot of languages.
   - Developed by Monotype and Adobe.

| |Font|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|Main Font|**Roboto**|
|Headline Font|**Roboto Light**|
|Code Font|**Noto Mono**|

> **Note:**
>
> * Roboto is very nice with Adapta, but in some locales, it causes Tofu.
